<h2>About Quotle</h2>
<p>Quotle is like Wordle but you guess each of the words in a famous quote. Unlike Wordle, with Quotle the words can be any length, and you can have as many guesses as you like. After each guess, you will be able to see if a letter is <span class="correct">c</span><span class="correct">o</span><span class="correct">r</span><span class="correct">r</span><span class="correct">e</span><span class="correct">c</span><span class="correct">t</span>, <span class="misplaced">m</span><span class="misplaced">i</span><span class="misplaced">s</span><span class="misplaced">p</span><span class="misplaced">l</span><span class="misplaced">a</span><span class="misplaced">c</span><span class="misplaced">e</span><span class="misplaced">d</span>, or <span class="wrong">w</span><span class="wrong">r</span><span class="wrong">o</span><span class="wrong">n</span><span class="wrong">g</span>.</p>
<p>Quotle was built by Calvin Murphy using Ruby on Rails and a Postgres database. Authentication is done with the Devise gem. I used Cascading Stylesheets to make the site's appearance, and Javascript for the guessing form. Code available on <%= link_to "Github", "https://github.com/Jafea-gif/quotle/" %></p>
